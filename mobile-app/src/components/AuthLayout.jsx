 * Shared layout used for authentication screens.
 *
 * This component wraps its children in a safe area and a keyboard avoiding view.
 * The background colour is set to the light peach tone defined in the tailwind
 * config so that all auth screens share the same warm, friendly appearance.
 *
 * If you need additional padding or spacing around your screen contents, set
 * those directly on the children rather than here â€“ this keeps the layout
 * flexible.
